            Austin is known for its incredible music, delicious restaurants and food trucks, and vibrant tech scene. It's a perfect city for weekend getaways, especially if you love BBQ and the outdoors.
            I love the city so much I actually moved there for over 8 years before returning to New York City.
            Austin is a lively, fun city, with a lot of unique things to see and do. Plus, nothing is more than 20 minutes away from anywhere else, so you won't be spending ages getting around like in huge metropolises.
            To help you pick the best place to stay during your trip, here's my list of the best hotels in Austin<br><br>
